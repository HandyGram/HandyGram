  ///
  /// * [size]: Limit on the total size of files after deletion, in bytes. Pass -1 to use the default limit.
  /// * [ttl]: Limit on the time that has passed since the last time a file was accessed (or creation time for some filesystems). Pass -1 to use the default limit.
  /// * [count]: Limit on the total number of files after deletion. Pass -1 to use the default limit.
  /// * [immunityDelay]: The amount of time after the creation of a file during which it can't be deleted, in seconds. Pass -1 to use the default value.
  /// * [fileTypes]: If non-empty, only files with the given types are considered. By default, all types except thumbnails, profile photos, stickers and wallpapers are deleted.
  /// * [chatIds]: If non-empty, only files from the given chats are considered. Use 0 as chat identifier to delete files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos).
  /// * [excludeChatIds]: If non-empty, files from the given chats are excluded. Use 0 as chat identifier to exclude all files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos).
  /// * [returnDeletedFileStatistics]: Pass true if statistics about the files that were deleted must be returned instead of the whole storage usage statistics. Affects only returned statistics.
  /// * [chatLimit]: Same as in getStorageStatistics. Affects only returned statistics.
